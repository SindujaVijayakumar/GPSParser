NMEA supports many message types or sentence codes. The idea of NMEA is to send a line of data called a sentence that is totally self contained and independent from other sentences. The most important NMEA sentences include the GGA which provides the current Fix data, the RMC which provides the minimum gps sentences information, and the GSA which provides the Satellite status data.

The sample file contained NMEA sentences with the following codes:
1. $GNRMC
2. $GNVTG
3. $GNGGA
4. $GNGSA
5. $GPGSV
6. $GNGLL

The structure of each of these message types are given below:

1. RMC - Recommended minimum specific GPS/Transit data -position, velocity, time data. 

  Examples:

        7    = Speed over ground in knots
        8    = Track made good in degrees True
        9    = UT date
        10   = Magnetic variation degrees (Easterly var. subtracts from true course)
        11   = E or W
        12   = Checksum


2. VTG - Velocity made good. 
  Examples: 
    $GPVTG,054.7,T,034.4,M,005.5,N,010.2,K

    where:
            VTG          Track made good and ground speed
            054.7,T      True track made good

            4    = not used
            5    = Speed over ground in knots
            6    = Fixed text 'N' indicates that speed over ground in in knots
            7    = Speed over ground in kilometers/hour
            8    = Fixed text 'K' indicates that speed over ground is in kilometers/hour
            9    = Checksum
            
      $--VTG,x.x,T,x.x,M,x.x,N,x.x,K

      where: 
            x.x,T = Track, degrees True
            x.x,M = Track, degrees Magnetic
            x.x,N = Speed, knots
            x.x,K = Speed, Km/hr


3. GGA - GPS fix data

$GPGGA,123519,4807.038,N,01131.000,E,1,08,0.9,545.4,M,46.9,M,,*47

Where:
     GGA          = Global Positioning System Fix Data
     123519       = Fix taken at 12:35:19 UTC
     4807.038,N   = Latitude 48 deg 07.038' N
     01131.000,E  = Longitude 11 deg 31.000' E
     1            = Fix quality:  
                    0 = invalid
                    1 = GPS fix (SPS)
                    2 = DGPS fix
                    3 = PPS fix

                      ellipsoid
     empty field  = time in seconds since last DGPS update
     empty field  = DGPS station ID number
     *47          = the checksum data, always begins with *
If the height of geoid is missing then the altitude may be incorrect. This is the only sentence that reports altitude.

4. GSA - GPS DOP and Active Satellites

This sentence provides details on the nature of the fix. It includes the numbers of the satellites being used in the current solution and the DOP. DOP (dilution of precision) is an indication of the effect of satellite geometry on the accuracy of the fix. It is a unitless number where smaller is better. For 3D fixes using 4 satellites a 1.0 would be considered to be a perfect number, however for overdetermined solutions it is possible to see numbers below 1.0.

    $GPGSA,A,3,04,05,,09,12,,,24,,,,,2.5,1.3,2.1*39

    Where:
        GSA    =  Satellite status
        A      =  Auto selection of 2D or 3D fix (M = manual) 
        3      =  3D fix - values include: 1 = no fix
                                          2 = 2D fix
                                          3 = 3D fix
        04,05..= IDs of satellites used in position fix, can be up to 12 satellites,              null for unused fields
        2.5    =  PDOP (dilution of precision) 
        1.3    =  Horizontal dilution of precision (HDOP) 
        2.1    =  Vertical dilution of precision (VDOP)
        *39    =  the checksum data, always begins with *

*if GN is used for Talker ID a separate sentence must to created for each GNSS constellation all starting with the Talker ID for multi GNSS.
Example:
$GNGSA,2,M,06,12,15,17,19,24,25,32,1.34,0.96,0.93*1D
$GNGSA,2,M,70,71,79,80,81,82,88,1.34,0.96,0.93*3A


5. GSV- GPS Satellites in View

This message shows data about the satellites that the unit might be able to find based on its viewing mask and almanac data. It also shows current ability to track this data. Note that one GSV sentence only can provide data for up to 4 satellites and thus there may need to be 3 sentences for the full information. It is reasonable for the GSV sentence to contain more satellites than GGA might indicate since GSV may include satellites that are not used as part of the solution. It is not a requirment that the GSV sentences all appear in sequence. To avoid overloading the data bandwidth some receivers may place the various sentences in totally different samples since each sentence identifies which one it is. If multi GNSS is used a separate GSV sentence must be created for each constellation starting with the constellation specific talker ID.

The field called SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) in the NMEA standard is often referred to as signal strength. SNR is an indirect but more useful value that raw signal strength. It can range from 0 to 99 and has units of dB according to the NMEA standard, but the various manufacturers send different ranges of numbers with different starting numbers so the values themselves cannot necessarily be used to evaluate different units. The range of working values in a given gps will usually show a difference of about 25 to 35 between the lowest and highest values, however 0 is a special case and may be shown on satellites that are in view but not being tracked.

    $GPGSV,2,1,08,01,40,083,46,02,17,308,41,12,07,344,39,14,22,228,45*75

      Where:
            GSV          Satellites in view
            2            Number of sentences for full data
            1            sentence 1 of 2
            08           Number of satellites in view

            01           Satellite PRN number
            40           Elevation, degrees

            46           SNR - higher is better
                for up to 4 satellites per sentence
            *75          the checksum data, always begins with *
